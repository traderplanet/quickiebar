QuickieBar makes it easy for you to convert visitors by adding an attractive and easily customizable conversion bar to the top or bottom of your site.

== Description ==

Quickly add a powerful drop down conversion bar to your site and start converting visitors. Grab your visitor’s attention with an attractive opt-in bar displayed either at the top or bottom of your site, and direct them to product page, signup page, or newsletter subscribe page.

QuickieBar is completely responsive and designed to look great on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Customize options of your bar to adhere to your brand standards, or pop out from the page. Choose from a multitude of colors (preset or custom), bar styles, and button styles.

QuickieBar comes with over 500 icons that you can use anywhere in your bar (provided by FontAwesome).

Instant previewing of your bar while you create it means that you can see your changes in real time. You can also click a button to preview the bar directly on your site.

Advanced conversion reporting allows you to dive into metrics on your bars, and see how successful they are over time. Each bar you create is tracked separately, so you can test different messages and bar colors to optimize conversion.

Conversion bars like the ones you can make with QuickieBar are starting to appear all over the web to help site owners drive traffic to conversion pages. QuickieBar enables you to outfit your site with a similar (and in many cases, more sophisticated and attractive) bar in seconds.

= Browser Compatibility List =

While ideally QuickieBar would work perfectly in every browser, outdated browsers can cause bars to look unattractive or display inconsistently across different devices. As such, I have opted to not display any bar to users using older browsers, instead of showing them one of lower quality.

QuickieBar **should** display perfectly in the following browsers. Users viewing your site on browsers not on this list will simply not be shown your conversion bar (they will also not be tracked for Views or Conversions).

* Google Chrome 4+
* Firefox 3.5+
* Safari 3.1+
* Internet Explorer 10+

If you notice any inconsistencies in the way your bars display to visitors using these browsers, please let me know [here](https://quickiebar.com/support) and I will do what I can to fix the issue.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

###My bar is not showing up in the correct place. What should I do?
or…
###QuickieBar is messing up my header. What should I do?

Due to the nature of displaying a bar at a fixed position at the top of a site, some page layouts will inherently not “play nice” with a fixed bar at the top of the page. Either they themselves used fixed positioning to place components on the page (such as a sidebar or header), or they use javascript to lay out certain items vertically on the page. While I have done everything possible to make this plugin as compatible with as many themes as possible, it is impossible to work perfectly with every theme (Twenty Fourteen is a great example, since it uses a fixed positioned header).

The first thing you’ll want to try is enabling “Fixed Header Compatibility Mode” from the Settings page. This will attempt to adjust the position of your fixed header when QuickieBar bars are displayed.

You can try using the “Bottom” placement for your bar or disabling the “Sticky” option, as bars that are configured to stick to the top of the page are usually the ones causing the layout issues.

If none of these options fix the layout problems, you should open a ticket [here](https://quickiebar.com/support) and make sure to describe the issue as well as include the name of the theme that your site uses.


###X Feature is not working. What should I do?

Open a ticket [here](https://quickiebar.com/support). Describe what isn’t working, what should be happening, and provide the name of the theme you are using.


###How do the cookies work behind the scenes?

When a new visitor accesses your site, QuickieBar saves a cookie that persists a non-personally-identifiable ID for that visitor across all page views. If a bar is shown, that ID is logged as a “view” for whatever bar was shown. If that same user clicks on the bar, then that ID is logged as a “conversion” for whatever bar was shown.

If a visitor closes the bar, they will not be shown that bar again (for up to 7 days). All cookies persist for 7 days, so if that same person comes back after 7 days, they will be treated as a new visitor and be shown the bar and have views and conversions logged.


###When I deactivate or uninstall the plugin, is all my data deleted?

No. If you wish to delete all data when uninstalling the plugin, click “Delete all plugin settings & data” at the bottom of the QuickieBar Settings page. This will deactivate the plugin and erase all settings & data associated with the plugin. You can then “Delete” the plugin files just like any other plugin.


###What information (if any) is sent to third-party sites (such as quickiebar.com)?

By default, no information is sent to quickiebar.com. You can opt in to receive infrequent product updates, in which case only your email address and website URL are saved to our mailchimp newsletter list.
